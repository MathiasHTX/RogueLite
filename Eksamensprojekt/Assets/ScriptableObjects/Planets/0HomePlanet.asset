  description: Just like any other beings, one needs a place to return home to after
    a long day filled with action. Your home planet is the place you know best, where
    you have a cottage, a garden, and beautiful green landscapes, just like back
    on Earth. Nothing fades away in this place, it's just you in peace, with opportunities
    to build and upgrade your weapons and properties.
