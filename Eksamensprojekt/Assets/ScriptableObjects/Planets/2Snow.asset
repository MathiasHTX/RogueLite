  title: SNOWDRIFT SUMMIT
  planetNumber: 2
  description: The landscape of this planet is covered in what appears to be snow,
    stretching endlessly. If that wasn't enough, it is also inhabited by large dangerous
    enemies, even more aggressive than the green slimy blobs on Evergreen Oasis.
    The monsters on this planet are harder to defeat, but their rewards are much
    higher.
